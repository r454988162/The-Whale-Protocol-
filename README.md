#The Whale Protocol 

The Whale Protocol is a cross-chain protocol. It will cooperate with the layer-2 network to carry out cross-chain exchange for most public chains.At present, BSC, HECO, ETH, and TRON will be tested to make users cross the chain through multiple chains to add liquidity.For example, there is a wallet that has USDTBSC of BSC and USDTHECO of HECO, users must upload a certain amount of USDT through two chains respectively to add the liquidity of The Whale Protocol on the layer-2 network. If the liquidity is insufficient, they can also exchange part of it to another network, but there may be some slippage in the early liquidity pool.
The Whale Protocol Roadmap:
The first phase: will debug the API of BSC, HECO, ETH, and TRON, and launch the test version.
The second phase: will formally launch and start Genesis mining. 10000 USDT will be collected for each public chain, and the liquidity pool will be locked by the official.
The third phase: the TWP token will be distributed as the outcome of Genesis mining, and start formal liquidity mining.
The fourth phase: will start community governance, such as cross-chain fee sharing and so on.
The circulation of TWP is tentatively 100 million
70% will come from mining
20% will be assigned to the team and linearly unlocked according to the mining schedule
10% will be allocated to early supporters and users
